Coconut Waffles are Cambodian-style coconut waffles. They are a popular street food eaten as a dessert (even though I still ate them for breakfast). The waffles are sweet enough from the palm sugar, coconut milk and cream, that they aren’t eaten with syrup. The rice flour gives the waffles a crispy outside and a chewy inside.
Ingredient:
- 350 grams of rice flour 
- 3 tablespoons noodles 
- 2 eggs 
- 1 bowl of coconut paste 
- Half a bowl of sugar 
- Half a bowl of chopped coconut meat 
- Half a teaspoon of salt 
- Frying oil 
- Sesame
Direction:
1. First, mix rice flour with salt and noodles and mix well. 
2. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and beat until smooth, then add the sugar and stir well. 
3. Stir in the coconut milk and mix well, then add the rice flour mixed with the coconut and sesame seeds. 
4. Stir well and leave for about 10 minutes. 
5. 10 minutes later, put the mold on the fire and oil on both sides, keep it hot, then pour the flour into the mold and let it boil on both sides.
