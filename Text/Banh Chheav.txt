Instructions 
Combine crepe batter ingredients. Set aside. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Sauté the filling, except for the bean sprouts.
Lightly brush a large, non-stick pan with vegetable oil. Heat over medium-high heat until smoking. Add enough crepe mixture to just cover the bottom of the pan (the thinner the better) and tilt pan, swirling batter to cover base and slightly up the side. Cook, covered, for approximately 2 minutes. 
Add bean sprouts and meat mixture, return lid to pan for approx. 2 min. or until underside is golden brown & bean sprouts are slightly softened. Fold crepe in half & transfer to a plate. Cover with foil. Repeat the process with the remaining crepe & filling mixture. Cut each crepe into quarters and serve with lettuce wrap, garnish with mint, Thai basil & cucumbers. Serve with dipping sauce.
Makes approximately 6 large crepes
