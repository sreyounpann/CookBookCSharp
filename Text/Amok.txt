What is “amok”? If you’re visiting Southeast Asia on our culinary tours in Cambodia and Vietnam, you’re sure to hear of (and taste) Cambodian amok, but what exactly is it?
An amok Khmer recipe is a traditional Khmer (Cambodian) dish usually made with fish, although chicken and beef amok are also popular. The food is traditionally a bit like a curry stew served in a boat made of banana leaves. An amok Cambodia can be served with or without rice.
If you sign up for our culinary tour Cooking and Culture of Vietnam and Cambodia you take a Khmer cooking class that will likely feature a Cambodian fish amok recipe. Or, if you can’t wait until then, try this fabulous fish amok recipe from our Khmer cooking class in Cambodia.
