 Nom Korng (Cambodian Donuts)
Nom Korng is the type of donut many people choose to buy for breakfast. Sold in Cambodian markets, this type of cake is made from rice flour, sweetened with jaggery, and sprinkled with sesame seeds. Although donuts are found worldwide, Nom Korng seems to be made without much influence from the outside, so it retains its own character in Cambodian culinary culture.
