Ingredients
500g (1 lb) sirloin/striploin steak, cut into roughly 3cm/1½ inch cubes
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 red onion, cut into wedges
1 tomato, sliced
lettuce leaves to serve
steamed rice to serve (click here to see my recipe for how to cook rice)
 
Marinade:
1 tbsp oyster sauce
1 tbsp soy sauce
2 tsp sweet dark soy sauce
1 tsp ground Kampot pepper*
1 tsp cornflour (cornstarch)
½ tsp baking soda
2 garlic cloves, finely grated
 
Stir-fry sauce:
2 tbsp oyster sauce
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tsp sugar
 
Dipping sauce:
3 tbsp lime juice
1 tsp ground Kampot pepper*
1 tsp sea salt
Steps

Combine the beef with all the marinade ingredients. Mix well.

Combine the stir-fry sauce ingredients. Set aside for later.

Combine the dipping sauce ingredients. Set aside until ready to serve.

Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or large frying pan over high heat. Add the beef and spread out in the pan. Sear for about half a minute and then toss. Repeat another 3 times until the beef is starting to char. Add the onions and toss through for a few seconds. Add the stir-fry sauce mixture and toss for another half a minute (for medium beef) or longer for well done. Turn the heat off and allow the beef to rest in the pan for about a minute.

In the meantime, spread the lettuce leaves out on a serving plate. Top with slices of tomato. Then top with the beef. Serve with steamed rice and the dipping sauce.

Notes:
– Kampot pepper is a type of peppercorn from the Kampot region of Cambodia. It has a mild, fragrant aroma and flavour. If unavailable, use half the amount of freshly ground black peppercorns.
